The NBA has for long been a widely admired and celebrated facet of American popular culture. Every season, the average fan has the opportunity to watch the best players on the face of the earth go at each other, night after night, in nail-biting intensity. As an avid fan of the NBA, I too am a consumer of the NBA and its professional basketball content. This became foundational in my life in 2019 when my hometown Toronto Raptors had an amazing run in the playoffs and won the NBA championship. The NBA is well known for being a league full of tall players and as my data suggests, this is true. However, the Toronto Raptors team that won the NBA finals had two relatively short players: Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry. Being a relatively short man myself, I was mesmerized by their abilities to perform at the highest level and their abilities to score the basketball and impact the game. As such, In this Paper, I attempt to explore the true parameters which contribute to players scoring output.
